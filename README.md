## Customer marketing analysis





### Project Overview üïÆ

Given the importance of this analysis, I chose to work with data sourced from Kaggle due to the lack of accessible private company data suitable for scraping and usage. Despite the absence of proprietary datasets, Kaggle provided a robust and comprehensive dataset that allowed me to delve into marketing campaign effectiveness and customer behavior analysis. This dataset offered a rich foundation for exploring various aspects of marketing performance and customer segmentation.

Utilizing Python and libraries such as NumPy, I conducted an in-depth analysis to uncover actionable insights. NumPy‚Äôs capabilities were instrumental in efficiently processing and manipulating the data, enabling me to perform complex calculations and statistical analysis. By leveraging this powerful tool, I was able to clean, normalize, and analyze the data, ultimately deriving valuable conclusions about customer engagement patterns and campaign effectiveness.
